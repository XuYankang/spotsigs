We have Temporary positions for the Holiday season, and at other special times of the year, such as Back-to-School. These positions are for people who want temporary employment, 13 weeks or less. Successful associates are friendly, enthusiastic and like working with people. Associates must read information and follow instructions, for example Company correspondence and store procedures. Most temporary positions offer flexible hours of work, which include weekdays or weeknights, and weekend time (Saturday or Sunday).
