I work M-Thurs, would require you at my home from 7:15am-4:30pm. Our Nanny is pregnant and is being induced on 1/15/12 so we need temporary care until she is able to return to work. It would be from 3-6 weeks depending on her recovery. Please contact me if you are available and able to work the hours listed. Thank you<img src="http://img.topusajobs.com/img2/SITNCQrqG628b/tab.gif" border="0">
